## Web3 Gaming Projects Explorer

This web application explores Web3 gaming projects using the CoinMarketCap RESTful JSON API (CMC). It displays a fixed list of the top 5 most popular projects retrieved from the API, along with a scrollable list of favorite projects marked by the user. Users can navigate to detailed views of projects and mark/unmark them as favorites. Favorite status is stored locally on the device using React Hooks. Robust error handling is implemented for API requests, and a user-friendly message is displayed when there is a network error or if the API request fails. The UI is developed according to responsive web design principles and is easily navigated using both desktop and mobile devices.
